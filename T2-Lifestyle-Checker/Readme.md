# T2 - Lifestyle Checker Web App

## Introduction

A local health authority wants to provide lifestyle choice information to its registered patients. This information will be displayed to relevant patients based on their current lifestyle choices. To do this the local authority would like to build a simple web application that patients can use. The web application will work as follows

- Ask the user to enter their NHS Number and details, the system will then call an API to identify the patient.
- The application will ask the user a number of simple questions about their current lifestyle choices, the answers to these along with their age will be used to generate a risk score. Users who score over a certain threshold will be directed to the information pack.

## Part One

Create a web based app that asks the user to provide the following details

- NHS Number
- Surname
- Date of Birth

The app should then validate the user as a valid patient by calling the following api
(see notes )

`https://al-tech-test-apim.azure-api.net/tech-test/t2/patients/{nhsNumber}`

The api will respond with a 404 if the patient cannot be found or a json body like the one below

```json
{

  nhsNumber: "123456789",
  name: "DOE, John",
  born: "25-12-1990"
}
```

There are 4 possible outcomes

- Patient cannot be found - user is shown "Your details could not be found" message
- Patient found, but details do not match - user is shown "Your details could not be found" message
- Patient found, details match but they are under 16 years old - user is shown a message "You are not eligble for this service"
- Patient found and details match - user progresses to part 2

## Part Two

The application will ask the citizen to answer the following 3 questions

- Q1. Do you drink on more than 2 days a week?
- Q2. Do you smoke?
- Q3. Do you exercise more than 1 hour per week?

After submitting their answers the application will generate a score based on the following scoring chart.

### Scoring

For questions 1 & 2 the points are awarded for anwsering yes, but for question 3 points are awarded for answering no. All questions must be answered.

AGE | 16 -21 | 22 - 40 | 41 -65 | 64+ |
----|--------|---------|--------|-----|
Q1  | 1      | 2       | 3      | 3   |
Q2  | 2      | 2       | 2      | 3   |
Q3  | 1      | 3       | 2      | 1   |


There are two possible outcomes

- The user scores 3 or less - they are shown a message "Thank you for answering our questions, we don't need to see you at this time. Keep up the good work!"
- The user scores 4 or more - they are shown a message "We think there are some simple things you could do to improve you quality of life, please phone to book an appointment"

## Part Three (Optional / Advanced)

How could the code be implemented in such a way that the scoring mechanism could be altered without requiring the code to be recompiled and re-deployed? This could be a change to age groups or scores for individual questions.

## API Details

You will need to provide a subscription key to make calls to the API, this subscription key must be sent in the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header. The subscription key will be provided separately.

**NB: You should not check this subscription key into your code repository, you may be marked down if you do so.**

There are 5 patients configured, which should allow you to test various scenarios
